# Contributing

Hey! Thanks for wanting to contribute to Networking Toolbox 🎉

## Getting Started

Checkout the [README](https://github.com/mwakidenis/networking-toolbox?tab=readme-ov-file#developing) for setup instructions, it's all very standard (clone, cd, npm install, npm run dev).

## Code Style

The usual, just keep it reasonably clean and consistent. Like normal TypeScript + Svelte stuff.

## Before You Submit

Don't forget to ensure that all checks pass. If you just run `npm run hold-my-beer` then you should be good to go!

For all project commands, take a look at the [the readme](https://github.com/mwakidenis/networking-toolbox?tab=readme-ov-file#project-commands) or just the [`package.json`](https://github.com/mwakidenis/networking-toolbox/blob/main/package.json). 

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details.

If you mention .NET I might block you. Just kidding. Maybe.
